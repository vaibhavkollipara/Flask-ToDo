Testing Rest Api :

 start python shell and import api-test functions and execute them to test backend
 
 


1. If I have 1 week to update this application,I would have learn't React and I would have created a good looking UI and add User registration and 
let each user have different todo tasks

2. I generally use django and angular 2 for fullstack web application.I'm new to flask and yet to start learn react.
Since I need to use flask and React for this test, both are new to me but I think I succeded in building backend rest api
but couldn't do the front end part as it took some time for setting up the environment.But to test the backend api I developed a
command line client(api-test.py) which has different functions for different api calls.
